# Clone openshift/coredns to a temporary directory and tell it to
# use our local copy of coredns-mdns when it builds.

# Optionally takes one parameter: the directory in which to clone
# coredns. If not provided, a temporary directory will be created
# and deleted after the build finishes. If it is provided, the
# directory specified will be used and not deleted at the end.
# However, any 'src' subdirectory found there will be deleted to
# ensure a clean copy of coredns is used. This allows for quicker
# iteration as the entire contents of the go pkg directory don't
# have to be downloaded each time.

# The resulting coredns binary will be copied to the coredns-mdns
# repo root.
